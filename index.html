                <h2>Programme Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Deep learning has gained significant attention within the computational intelligence community over
                    the recent years. Its success has been mainly due to the increased capability of modern computers to
                    collect, store and process large volumes of data. This has led to a substantial increase in the
                    effectiveness and efficiency of data management. As a result, it has become possible to achieve high
                    accuracy within a short time frame for some benchmark learning tasks such as object classification
                    and image recognition. The most common implementation of deep learning has been through neural
                    networks due to the ability of their layers to perform multiple functional composition as part of a
                    multistage learning process. However, despite the significant advances in deep learning, there are
                    also limitations. Effectiveness is usually adversely affected when data are not well defined due to
                    inherent noise, uncertainty, ambiguity, vagueness and incompleteness. This has an adverse impact on
                    efficiency due to the necessity to refine the data by additional collection, analysis and cleaning.
                    The reduced effectiveness and efficiency undermine the ability of deep learning to address some
                    real-life tasks that are safety critical or time critical systems. Besides this, deep leaning has
                    been used mainly in a passive manner for the purpose of observing the environment, but it almost has
                    not been used in an active manner for the purpose of changing the environment. Finally, deep
                    learning models often have poor transparency which makes them difficult for understanding,
                    explanation, and interpretation by non-technical users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep fuzzy systems could address some of these problems and limitations. Deep learning can also be
                    used for developing fuzzy systems that can solve more complicated tasks in more dynamic
                    environments. DFS have been around in different forms and under different names such as hierarchical
                    fuzzy systems and networked fuzzy systems. DFS are well suited for performing multiple functional
                    composition at both crisp and linguistic level. Moreover, they have the potential of handling
                    effectively and efficiently data that are not well defined, due to the ability of fuzzy logic to
                    deal successfully with different types of uncertainty. Also, DFS can be used in both passive and
                    active manner with regards to the environment due to their generic structure. Finally, these systems
                    have a high level of transparency due to the ability of fuzzy rules to capture well the interactions
                    between input and output variables.

                    <h2>Scope</h2>

                    <p>This special session aims to bring together contributions on recent advances in deep fuzzy

                        (DFS), both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. As such, the session will provide a
