                <h2>Programme Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The tutorial focuses on the analysis and design of fuzzy networks. It highlights some recent
                    research results of the presenters as the ones from the publications listed below. Fuzzy
                    networks are similar to neural networks in terms of general structure. However, their nodes
                    and connections are different. The nodes of fuzzy networks are fuzzy systems represented by
                    rule bases and the connections between the nodes are outputs from and inputs to these rule
                    bases. In this context, apart from being a structural counterpart for a neural network, a fuzzy
                    network is also a conceptual generalisation of a fuzzy system.

                    <h2>Scope</h2>

                    <p>Fuzzy networks have an underlying two-dimensional grid structure with horizontal levels and
                        vertical layers. The levels represent spatial hierarchy in terms of network breadth and the
                        layers represent temporal hierarchy in terms of network depth.

                        The nodes of fuzzy networks are modelled by Boolean matrices or binary relations. The
                        connections between the nodes are modelled by block schemes or topological expressions. Each
                        network node is located in a cell within the underlying grid structure.

                        Nodes in fuzzy networks are manipulated by merging and splitting operations. The merging
                        operations are for network analysis and the splitting operations are for network design. These
                        operations are used for converting a fuzzy network into a fuzzy system and vice versa.

                        The operations are illustrated on feedforward and feedback fuzzy networks. Feedforward networks
                        include combinations of narrow/broad and shallow/deep network structures. Feedback networks
                        include combinations of single/multiple and local/global feedback loops.

                        Fuzzy networks are applied to case studies from engineering, computing, transport and finance.
                        They are validated successfully against standard and hierarchical fuzzy systems. The validation
                        uses performance evaluation indicators for feasibility, accuracy, efficiency, transparency.
